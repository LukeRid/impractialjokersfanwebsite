        As they are best friends they don’t let each other get of lightly during the challenges and punishment. Whilst one is afraid of kittens and cats there has been a couple of his punishments involving them. And because he can’t back out of the punishment he had to go through with it. Whilst another joker is afraid of spider's and tarantulas he did a simular punishment.

        Danica McKellar, Gary Busey and Jeff Daniels are a few of the faces that have been in the challenge and or punishments to get the best reactions out of the jokers.
